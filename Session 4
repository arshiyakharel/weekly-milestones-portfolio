Aim: complete the following tutorials
functions (done)
classes 

challenges/ things learnt:
functions: 
In this exercise, I learned how to differentiate between a list 
and a single element in the list, and how data flows through functions:
the list is returned, each element is looped over,
and a function is called for each item. 
I also practiced string concatenation and formatting to create dynamic 
messages.

objects and classes:
In this exercise, I learned not to put commas in numbers in
Python and that it’s better to use neutral defaults in a class 
and assign real values to each instance.

next steps: 
Dictionaries
Modules and Packages
